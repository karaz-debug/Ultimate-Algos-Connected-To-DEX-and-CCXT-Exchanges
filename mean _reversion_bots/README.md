1. Introduction
Jim Simons, the mastermind behind the Medallion Fund, achieved extraordinary annual returns by leveraging sophisticated quantitative strategies. Among these, Reversion and Deja Vu Reversion strategies played pivotal roles in capitalizing on market inefficiencies. This document provides a detailed, beginner-friendly exploration of these two strategies, guiding you through their concepts, implementation steps, and backtesting using the backtesting.py library in Python.

2. Understanding Reversion Strategies
Concept of Reversion
Reversion in trading refers to the tendency of a stock's price to return to its average or mean value after deviating significantly in either direction. This concept is grounded in the idea that extreme price movements are often temporary and that prices will revert to their historical norms over time.

Key Components:

Mean (Average) Price: The central value around which the stock's price oscillates.
Deviation: The extent to which the stock's price moves away from the mean.
Reversion: The process of the price moving back towards the mean after a significant deviation.
Illustrative Example:

Mean Price Calculation: Suppose a stock has an average (mean) price of $50 over the past 50 days.
Price Deviation: On Day 51, the stock price spikes to $60.
Reversion Expectation: Based on historical behavior, it's expected that the price will revert towards $50 over the next few days.
Trading Action: A trader might decide to short the stock at $60, anticipating a price decline back to $50.
Deja Vu Reversion
Deja Vu Reversion is an advanced form of the standard reversion strategy. It involves identifying specific patterns or signals that have historically led to price reversals. The term "Deja Vu" signifies recognizing recurring patterns that precede a reversion.

Key Components:

Pattern Recognition: Identifying specific conditions or setups that have consistently preceded price reversals.
Predictive Signals: Using historical data to predict when the price is likely to revert based on identified patterns.
Automated Execution: Implementing these patterns into trading algorithms to systematically execute trades when conditions are met.
Illustrative Example:

Pattern Identification: Over the past 100 days, whenever a stock's price drops by more than 5% within a day, it tends to recover by 3% the next day.
Signal Generation: Recognize when the stock's price falls by more than 5%.
Trading Action: Buy the stock after a 5% drop, anticipating a 3% recovery based on historical patterns.
3. Step-by-Step Guide to Implementing Reversion Strategies
Implementing these strategies involves several steps, from data preparation to strategy design and backtesting.

Data Preparation
Before implementing any trading strategy, ensure you have clean and comprehensive historical data. This data should include:

Price Data: Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) prices.
Volume Data: Trading volumes can provide additional insights.
Additional Indicators: Depending on the strategy, you might need other indicators like RSI, MACD, etc.
Steps:

Data Collection: Obtain historical price data for the stock(s) you intend to trade. Sources include Yahoo Finance, Quandl, or brokerage APIs.
Data Cleaning: Ensure there are no missing values, and handle any anomalies.
Data Formatting: Structure the data in a format compatible with backtesting.py (typically a Pandas DataFrame with a DateTime index and OHLC columns).
Strategy Design
Designing the strategy involves defining the rules for when to enter and exit trades based on the reversion concepts.

Reversion Strategy
Objective: Identify when a stock's price deviates significantly from its mean and trade in anticipation of reversion.

Components:

Mean Calculation: Determine the moving average over a specific window.
Thresholds: Define what constitutes a significant deviation (e.g., 2 standard deviations from the mean).
Entry Signal: When the price moves beyond the threshold, trigger a trade opposite to the direction of the deviation.
Exit Signal: When the price reverts to the mean or crosses another predefined threshold.
Illustrative Steps:

Calculate Moving Average (Mean): Use a rolling window (e.g., 20 days).
Calculate Standard Deviation: Over the same window to determine volatility.
Determine Upper and Lower Bands: Mean ± (N * Standard Deviation), where N is typically 2.
Entry Rules:
Long Entry: If the price falls below the lower band, buy expecting reversion upwards.
Short Entry: If the price rises above the upper band, sell/short expecting reversion downwards.
Exit Rules:
Long Exit: Sell when the price reaches the mean or a target profit level.
Short Exit: Cover the short position when the price returns to the mean or a target profit level.
Deja Vu Reversion Strategy
Objective: Enhance the standard reversion strategy by incorporating specific patterns that have historically preceded price reversals.

Components:

Pattern Identification: Define specific conditions that have led to reversion in the past.
Signal Confirmation: Use additional indicators to confirm the validity of the pattern.
Automated Trade Execution: Implement these conditions into the trading algorithm for systematic execution.
Illustrative Steps:

Identify Patterns: For example, consecutive days of price drops exceeding a certain percentage.
Confirm with Indicators: Use RSI to ensure the stock is oversold.
Entry Rules:
Long Entry: After the identified pattern and confirmation by RSI, buy expecting price to revert upwards.
Exit Rules:
Long Exit: When the price reverts to the mean or RSI indicates overbought conditions.
Multiple Signal Validation: Combine with MACD to ensure momentum aligns with reversion expectations.
4. Backtesting with Backtesting.py
Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy on historical data to evaluate its performance. backtesting.py is a Python library that simplifies this process.

a. Setting Up the Environment
Requirements:

Python: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Libraries: Install necessary Python libraries.
Installation Steps:

Install backtesting.py:

bash
Copy code
pip install backtesting
Install Additional Libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
b. Implementing the Reversion Strategy
Below is a step-by-step implementation of the Reversion Strategy using backtesting.py.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the Reversion Strategy
class ReversionStrategy(Strategy):
    # Parameters to optimize
    window = 20  # Moving average window
    deviation = 2  # Number of standard deviations for threshold
    take_profit = 0.03  # 3% profit target
    stop_loss = 0.02  # 2% stop loss

    def init(self):
        # Calculate the moving average and standard deviation
        self.ma = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).mean()
        self.std = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).std()
        # Define upper and lower bands
        self.upper_band = self.ma + self.deviation * self.std
        self.lower_band = self.ma - self.deviation * self.std

    def next(self):
        price = self.data.Close[-1]

        # If not in position, check for entry signals
        if not self.position:
            # Long Entry
            if price < self.lower_band[-1]:
                self.buy(sl=price * (1 - self.stop_loss), tp=price * (1 + self.take_profit))
            # Short Entry
            elif price > self.upper_band[-1]:
                self.sell(sl=price * (1 + self.stop_loss), tp=price * (1 - self.take_profit))
        else:
            # Exit Conditions are handled by stop-loss and take-profit
            pass

# Load and prepare your data
# For demonstration, we'll use sample data from backtesting.py
from backtesting.test import GOOG

# Initialize Backtest
bt = Backtest(GOOG, ReversionStrategy, cash=10000, commission=.002)

# Run Backtest
stats = bt.run()
print(stats)

# Plot the results
bt.plot()

    rsi_oversold = 30
    macd_fast = 12
    macd_slow = 26
    macd_signal = 9
    take_profit = 0.03  # 3% profit target
    stop_loss = 0.02  # 2% stop loss

    def init(self):
        # Moving average and standard deviation
        self.ma = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).mean()
        self.std = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).std()
        self.upper_band = self.ma + self.deviation * self.std
        self.lower_band = self.ma - self.deviation * self.std

        # RSI Calculation
        delta = self.data.Close.diff()
        gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=self.rsi_period).mean()
        loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=self.rsi_period).mean()
        RS = gain / loss
        self.rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

        # MACD Calculation
        exp1 = self.data.Close.ewm(span=self.macd_fast, adjust=False).mean()
        exp2 = self.data.Close.ewm(span=self.macd_slow, adjust=False).mean()
        self.macd_line = exp1 - exp2
        self.signal_line = self.macd_line.ewm(span=self.macd_signal, adjust=False).mean()
        self.histogram = self.macd_line - self.signal_line

    def next(self):
        price = self.data.Close[-1]

Explanation of the Code:

Additional Indicators:

RSI (Relative Strength Index): Measures the speed and change of price movements to identify overbought or oversold conditions.
MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence): A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price.
Strategy Parameters:

RSI Parameters: Period, overbought, and oversold thresholds.
MACD Parameters: Fast, slow, and signal line periods.
Initialization (init method):

Moving Average and Bands: Same as the Reversion Strategy.
RSI Calculation: Computes the RSI based on price changes.
MACD Calculation: Computes MACD line, signal line, and histogram.
Trading Logic (next method):

Entry Conditions:
Long Entry: Price below the lower band, RSI below the oversold threshold, and positive MACD histogram.
Short Entry: Price above the upper band, RSI above the overbought threshold, and negative MACD histogram.
Exit Conditions: Automatically handled by the sl (stop loss) and tp (take profit) parameters.
Backtest Execution: Similar to the Reversion Strategy, initializes the backtest, runs it, and plots the results.

5. Backtesting Implementation
a. Setting Up the Environment
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. If not, install them using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install backtesting pandas numpy matplotlib
b. Implementing the Reversion Strategy
ReversionStrategy Class:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class ReversionStrategy(Strategy):
    # Strategy parameters
    window = 20  # Moving average window
    deviation = 2  # Number of standard deviations
    take_profit = 0.03  # 3% take profit
    stop_loss = 0.02  # 2% stop loss

    def init(self):
        # Calculate moving average and standard deviation
        self.ma = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).mean()
        self.std = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).std()
        # Define upper and lower bands
        self.upper_band = self.ma + self.deviation * self.std
        self.lower_band = self.ma - self.deviation * self.std

    def next(self):
        price = self.data.Close[-1]

        if not self.position:
            # Long Entry
            if price < self.lower_band[-1]:
                self.buy(sl=price * (1 - self.stop_loss), tp=price * (1 + self.take_profit))
            # Short Entry
            elif price > self.upper_band[-1]:
                self.sell(sl=price * (1 + self.stop_loss), tp=price * (1 - self.take_profit))
c. Implementing the Deja Vu Reversion Strategy
DejaVuReversionStrategy Class:

python
Copy code
class DejaVuReversionStrategy(Strategy):
    # Strategy parameters
    window = 20
    deviation = 2
    rsi_period = 14
    rsi_overbought = 70
    rsi_oversold = 30
    macd_fast = 12
    macd_slow = 26
    macd_signal = 9
    take_profit = 0.03
    stop_loss = 0.02

    def init(self):
        # Calculate moving average and standard deviation
        self.ma = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).mean()
        self.std = self.I(pd.Series.rolling, self.data.Close, self.window).std()
        self.upper_band = self.ma + self.deviation * self.std
        self.lower_band = self.ma - self.deviation * self.std

        # Calculate RSI
        delta = self.data.Close.diff()
        gain = (delta.where(delta > 0, 0)).rolling(window=self.rsi_period).mean()
        loss = (-delta.where(delta < 0, 0)).rolling(window=self.rsi_period).mean()
        RS = gain / loss
        self.rsi = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

        # Calculate MACD
        exp1 = self.data.Close.ewm(span=self.macd_fast, adjust=False).mean()
        exp2 = self.data.Close.ewm(span=self.macd_slow, adjust=False).mean()
        self.macd_line = exp1 - exp2
        self.signal_line = self.macd_line.ewm(span=self.macd_signal, adjust=False).mean()
        self.histogram = self.macd_line - self.signal_line

    def next(self):
        price = self.data.Close[-1]

        if not self.position:
            # Long Entry with RSI and MACD confirmation
            if (price < self.lower_band[-1] and
                self.rsi[-1] < self.rsi_oversold and
                self.histogram[-1] > 0):
                self.buy(sl=price * (1 - self.stop_loss), tp=price * (1 + self.take_profit))
            # Short Entry with RSI and MACD confirmation
            elif (price > self.upper_band[-1] and
                  self.rsi[-1] > self.rsi_overbought and
                  self.histogram[-1] < 0):
                self.sell(sl=price * (1 + self.stop_loss), tp=price * (1 - self.take_profit))
d. Running Backtests
Running the Reversion Strategy Backtest:

python
Copy code
# Load sample data from backtesting.py
from backtesting.test import GOOG

# Initialize Backtest for Reversion Strategy
bt_reversion = Backtest(GOOG, ReversionStrategy, cash=10000, commission=.002)

# Run Backtest
stats_reversion = bt_reversion.run()
print(stats_reversion)

# Plot the results
bt_reversion.plot()
Running the Deja Vu Reversion Strategy Backtest:

python
Copy code
# Initialize Backtest for Deja Vu Reversion Strategy
bt_dejavu = Backtest(GOOG, DejaVuReversionStrategy, cash=10000, commission=.002)

# Run Backtest
stats_dejavu = bt_dejavu.run()
print(stats_dejavu)

# Plot the results
bt_dejavu.plot()
Explanation of the Backtest Parameters:

Data: Using GOOG sample data provided by backtesting.py. Replace this with your dataset as needed.
Strategy: The strategy class to be tested (ReversionStrategy or DejaVuReversionStrategy).
Initial Cash: Starting with $10,000.
Commission: Trading commission set at 0.2% per trade.
5. Analyzing Backtest Results
After running the backtests, backtesting.py provides a summary of performance metrics and visual plots. Here's how to interpret and analyze them:

a. Performance Metrics
Key metrics include:

Equity Final [$]: Final account balance after the backtest.
Equity Peak [$]: Highest account balance during the backtest.
Return [%]: Overall percentage return.
Buy & Hold Return [%]: Return if you had simply bought and held the asset.
Max Drawdown [%]: Largest peak-to-trough decline in account balance.
Win Rate [%]: Percentage of profitable trades.
Profit Factor: Ratio of gross profits to gross losses.
Interpreting Metrics:

High Equity Final: Indicates substantial growth.
Low Max Drawdown: Suggests effective risk management.
High Win Rate & Profit Factor: Reflects a profitable and efficient strategy.
b. Equity Curve Plot
The equity curve visualizes the growth of the trading account over time, showing the impact of each trade. An upward-sloping equity curve indicates profitability, while frequent dips suggest volatility or losses.

Key Observations:

Consistent Growth: A steady upward trend indicates a robust strategy.
Frequent Drawdowns: May signal high volatility or ineffective trade exits.
Comparative Analysis: Compare the strategy's equity curve against the Buy & Hold strategy to assess relative performance.
c. Trade Log Analysis
backtesting.py provides a detailed log of all trades, including entry and exit points, profit/loss, and duration. Analyzing this can offer insights into:

Trade Frequency: How often the strategy trades.
Profitability: Average profit per trade.
Risk-Reward Ratio: Balancing potential profits against possible losses.
